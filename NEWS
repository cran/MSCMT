Changes in version 1.2.0 (2017-01-30)

New features

- automatic repeated estimation with different outer optimizers and random 
  seeds, optionally on a cluster.

Changes

- reasonable default parameters and documentation for outer optimizers
  have been added.

- improved cluster support: (malfunctioning) load balancing with parLapplyLB 
  replaced by load balancing via clusterApplyLB.

Bug fixes

- fixed special treatment of 'one sunny donor' case.


Changes in version 1.1.0 (2016-11-29)

New features

- newly supported outer optimizer "none" to implant 'artificial' solutions 
  (fixed w and optionally fixed v).

- many new outer optimizers are now supported, more documentation will follow.
  
- function compare() for comparison of estimation results, 
  including corresponding updates for print.mscmt and ggplot.mscmt.

Changes

- names of agg.fns (component of mscmt results) are now set automatically.

- user-defined agg.fns are now automatically exported to the cluster.

- changed default optimizer to DEoptC.

- predictor weights are not printed any more as verbose output in estimations.

- some packages were moved from "Imports" to "Suggests".

- number of calls to inner optimizer is now counted for benchmarking purposes.

- package startup message added.

Bug fixes

- objective function weights alpha/beta/gamma are now treated correctly.

- calls to the lp solver are now more robust.

- some typos in vignettes have been corrected.

- all data had to be sorted chronologically, this is now optional.

- improveSynth reported wrong 'True' W*(V) if W*(V) was not optimal.
