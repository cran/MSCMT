Changes in version 1.3.9 (2023-11-29)

Bug fixes

- fixed insecure REprintf() calls in package's C code (many thanks to Kurt
  Hornik for the hint).


Changes in version 1.3.8 (2023-11-13)

Changes

- removed support for package 'hydroPSO' (which has been archived).

Bug fixes

- fixed missing alias for package documentation (many thanks to Kurt Hornik 
  for the hint).


Changes in version 1.3.7 (2023-04-17)

Changes

- packages 'Synth', 'LowRankQP' and 'Rmalschains' have been archived recently. 
  All references to these packages' documentation, the support for 'malschains' 
  as outer optimizer and the support of 'LowRankQPOpt' as inner optimizer have
  been removed.

- the vignettes now use cached copies of the results obtained with package
  'Synth' (version: 1.1-6) because 'Synth' is currently not available on CRAN.

  some examples using package 'Synth' have been changed or removed.


Changes in version 1.3.6 (2023-03-09)

Bug fixes

- corrected S3 generic/method inconsistency in ggplot.mscmt. Code relying on 
  ggplot.mscmt's former argument order or the name of its first argument may 
  need revision.


Changes in version 1.3.5 (2023-01-31)

New features

- added support for weekly and daily data

Bug fixes

- removed (dispensable) LazyData entry from DESCRIPTION


Changes in version 1.3.4 (2019-11-14)

New features

- added preliminary support for specification search (for the optimal set of
  predictors to include in the model specification) as an enhancement for
  cross validation

Changes in version 1.3.4 (2019-11-14)

- tolerance of lp solver changed slightly

- added some flexibility (for the labels) to the ggplot method

- removed some unused (and unexported) code

- improveSynth now also checks whether the donor weights of synth()'s solution
  sum up to 1 (which they often do not!) and now also works when custom.v 
  is set in the preceding synth()-call. Checks for optimality are now (solely)
  based on relative suboptimality. This leads to a slight change in the
  corresponding vignette.


Bug fixes

- added missing author information for LINPACK/SLATEC Fortran code (many 
  thanks to Prof. Brian D. Ripley for the hint)


Changes in version 1.3.3 (2018-05-04)

Changes

- minor documentation update (references)

Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug in mscmt for multivariate applications introduced in
  version 1.3.2


Changes in version 1.3.2 (2018-02-19)

New features

- added list element 'predictor.table' containing aggregated statistics of
  predictor values to output of 'mscmt' (feature request)
  
Changes

- list element 'dataprep.scaled' (in output of 'mscmt') now contains unscaled
  variants 'X0.unscaled' and 'X1.unscaled' of (aggregated) predictor values


Changes in version 1.3.1 (2018-01-04)

Changes

- minor documentation update (references)

Bug fixes

- some fixes/increased robustness for edge cases (e.g. single predictor)

- progress bar fixed (thereby eliminating compiler warnings)


Changes in version 1.3.0 (2017-08-17)

New features

- cross validation is now supported by function mscmt, see the corresponding
  documentation.

Changes

- point size is now settable in ggplot.mscmt.

- lp's in ill-conditioned problems are now tackled with the help of various
  lp solvers to improve robustness. Packages Rglpk and lpSolveAPI are required
  now.

Bug fixes

- 'no sunny donors' case fixed.

- gamma-factors fixed.

- some small bug fixes in ggplot.mscmt.


Changes in version 1.2.0 (2017-01-30)

New features

- automatic repeated estimation with different outer optimizers and random 
  seeds, optionally on a cluster.

Changes

- reasonable default parameters and documentation for outer optimizers
  have been added.

- improved cluster support: (malfunctioning) load balancing with parLapplyLB 
  replaced by load balancing via clusterApplyLB.

Bug fixes

- fixed special treatment of 'one sunny donor' case.


Changes in version 1.1.0 (2016-11-29)

New features

- newly supported outer optimizer "none" to implant 'artificial' solutions 
  (fixed w and optionally fixed v).

- many new outer optimizers are now supported, more documentation will follow.
  
- function compare() for comparison of estimation results, 
  including corresponding updates for print.mscmt and ggplot.mscmt.

Changes

- names of agg.fns (component of mscmt results) are now set automatically.

- user-defined agg.fns are now automatically exported to the cluster.

- changed default optimizer to DEoptC.

- predictor weights are not printed any more as verbose output in estimations.

- some packages were moved from "Imports" to "Suggests".

- number of calls to inner optimizer is now counted for benchmarking purposes.

- package startup message added.

Bug fixes

- objective function weights alpha/beta/gamma are now treated correctly.

- calls to the lp solver are now more robust.

- some typos in vignettes have been corrected.

- all data had to be sorted chronologically, this is now optional.

- improveSynth reported wrong 'True' W*(V) if W*(V) was not optimal.
